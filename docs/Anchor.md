## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**id** | **String** | Anchor identifier.&lt;br&gt; **This property is a read-only property managed by the platform: it must not be provided at creation time or modified.**  | [optional] 
**created** | **Number** | Date of creation (in milliseconds since Unix epoch).&lt;br&gt; **This property is a read-only property managed by the platform: it must not be provided at creation time or modified.**  | [optional] 
**lastModified** | **Number** | Date of last modification (in milliseconds since Unix epoch).&lt;br&gt; **This property is a read-only property managed by the platform: it must not be provided at creation time or modified.**  | [optional] 
**name** | **String** | Anchor name (don&#39;t need to be unique). | 
**hash** | **String** | SHA256 hash (ie. the fingerprint) of the original data to anchor.&lt;br&gt; **This property must not be provided when creating a signature anchor: it is set at creation time to the SHA256 hash of the &#x60;signature&#x60; property provided (so the signature is what is actually anchored in this case).**  | 
**signedHash** | **String** | SHA256 hash (ie. the fingerprint) of the original data to sign.&lt;br&gt; **This property must not be provided when creating a data anchor.**  | [optional] 
**pubKey** | **String** | Public key of the signee.&lt;br&gt; **Currently only Bitcoin addresses are supported.**&lt;br&gt; **This property must not be provided when creating a data anchor.**  | [optional] 
**signature** | **String** | Signature of the &#x60;signedHash&#x60; property content using the public key stored in the &#x60;pubKey&#x60; property.&lt;br&gt; **Only Bitcoin signatures are currently supported.** **This property must not be provided when creating a data anchor.**  | [optional] 
**identityURL** | **String** | Web hook to be called whenever the signee identity has to be verified.&lt;br&gt; Calling this URL allows to verify that the owner of the URL (identified by the associated TLS certificate) also owns the public key used to produce the signature, by asking the URL to sign some random data.&lt;br&gt; This URL must use an HTTPS scheme with a valid and non expired TLS certificate.&lt;br&gt; This URL must implement the following GET operation:&lt;br&gt; input:&lt;br&gt; - &#x60;pubKey&#x60;: the public key of the signee (that is to be verified)&lt;br&gt; - &#x60;leftData&#x60;: a random SHA256 hash generated by the caller&lt;br&gt; output:&lt;br&gt; - &#x60;signature&#x60;: a valid signature of the string (&#x60;leftData&#x60; + &#x60;rightData&#x60;) produced using the public key &#x60;pubKey&#x60;&lt;br&gt; - &#x60;rightData&#x60;: a random SHA256 hash generated by the callee  | [optional] 
**_public** | **Boolean** | &#x60;true&#x60; (or unset) if the anchor is public. &#x60;false&#x60; if the anchor is private.&lt;br&gt; If this field is not set at creation time, the anchor is public by default.  | [optional] [default to true]
**notifyByEmail** | **Boolean** | &#x60;true&#x60; if the receipt must be sent by email once available.  | [optional] [default to false]
**tags** | **[String]** | Set of tags associated to the anchor. There is no restriction on tag names, except they cannot contain spaces.&lt;br&gt; Tags are aimed at classifying and searching anchors.  | [optional] 
**metadata** | **Object** | A JSON object containing a set of key/values to store with the anchor and giving additional information about the anchored data.&lt;br&gt; Values must be of type null, boolean, string or number: nested JSON objects are not allowed.&lt;br&gt; ex: { title: &#39;Ubik&#39;, author: &#39;Philip K. Dick&#39;, read: true, rank: 10.0, coauthor: null }  | [optional] 
**callbackURL** | **String** | Web hook to be called by the platform whenever the anchor status change: the platform does a POST request on this URL with the anchor as a JSON object in the request body.  | [optional] 
**status** | **String** | The status of the anchor:&lt;br&gt; - WAIT: waiting to be processed. The receipt is not yet available for download.&lt;br&gt; - NEW: to be sent to the blockchain. The receipt is not yet available for download.&lt;br&gt; - SENT: sent to the blockchain. The receipt is available for download.&lt;br&gt; - CONFIRMED: confirmed at least 6 times by the blockchain. The receipt is available for download.&lt;br&gt; **This property is a read-only property managed by the platform: it must not be provided at creation time or modified.**  | [optional] 
**timestamp** | **Number** | Proven timestamp of the data.&lt;br&gt; This is actually the time of the Bitcoin block into which the anchoring process occurred (in milliseconds since Unix epoch).&lt;br&gt; Any data whose SHA256 hash equals this anchor&#39;s hash is proven to be existent at that time and unmodified.&lt;br&gt; This field is set when the first confirmation of the Bitcoin block occurs.&lt;br&gt; **This property is a read-only property managed by the platform: it must not be provided at creation time or modified.**  | [optional] 
**confirmations** | **Number** | Number of confirmations of the Bitcoin block into which the anchoring happened.&lt;br&gt; This field is set when the first confirmation of the Bitcoin block occurs, and removed when the block is confirmed.&lt;br&gt; **This property is a read-only property managed by the platform: it must not be provided at creation time or modified.**  | [optional] 
**txId** | **String** | Identifier of the Bitcoin transaction where the anchoring occurred. | [optional]
